Only one feature type will be correct at any given time.<br/>Once you have decided which feature to use to select the correct circle, stick with it.<br/>However, the type of feature you should use also changes from time to time- When you feel like the correct feature has changed, you should start choosing based on the other feature, sticking with that one until you think that it is no longer correct.",
